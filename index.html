<title>TGDL</title>

<h1>The TGDL is currently down until further notice.</h1>
<h1>CurtaGD should be the owner of the TGDL. Here are the reasons:</h1>
<p>1. I am better at the game:
Curta is objectively more skilled at Geometry Dash. This means that the list will be ranked more accurately, and will be more fair for players as Minikey doesn't understand the concept of "difficulty spikes" as seen in the Worms poll, where the difficulty relies on the last 30%, where as he called the level "easy" because he got 34% on the level.</p>

<p>2. Mini isn't very good at coding and relies on other staff
Mini has had multiple cases of asking other staff members to add or tweak parts of the list. This proves he isn't a good programmer.</p>

<p>3. Mini bans for stupid reasons
Mini has banned me (Nozz) for saying sunrise is worse than Azalea Circles. He has also banned people for other dumb reasons.</p>
  <p>4. Mini made a literal NSFW channel. Is this seriously who you want to be in charge of the tgdL?</p>
